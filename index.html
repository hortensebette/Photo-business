            <h3>The beginning of photography</h3>
            <p>The term photography is the result of a series of technological and technical innovations in the fields
                of optics, chemistry, mechanics, electricity, electronics and computers. It is based on the biological
                mechanism of the human eye.
                Point de vue du Gras, the first result of an experiment by Nicéphore Niépce. This photograph represents
                a part of Niépce's property. It was taken in 1826.

                Since its invention, the use of photography has been closely linked to the evolution of its technique.

            <h3>Artistic photography</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, photography was used by painters as an aid to their work. It soon became a medium of
                expression in its own right, with many artists practising it alongside other modes of expression or
                devoting themselves exclusively to it.
                Painters applied their art to various forms of expression, specialising in genre scenes, decoration,
                history or portraiture; photographers soon explored various ways of making use of the new techniques
                available to them. And these applications multiplied with the progress and ease of use that followed.
                While portraiture developed rapidly as soon as exposure times were limited to a few minutes - with the
                help of chairs equipped with headrests and armrests - other photographic genres proliferated as soon as
                relatively portable and user-friendly equipment became available.
